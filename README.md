# 100th Polish Independence Day

**A landing page concept for the 100th anniversary of Polish' Independence.**

*Project content is written in Polish language*

## Purpose and goals

This website is made as part of a school project to promote information and awareness about this national holiday.

More personal goals of this projects are to explore very lightweight and fast landing page structure without sacrificing on creative and unique effects, such as in this case **parallax scrolling images**.
Also, it was important to allow mobile users experience those animations while keeping in mind that phones are far less powerful and can't use too much battery power.

## Design

Design in this case is a very clear and straight forward. Putting strong focus on drawings and using hand-written font on headers to better match the theme of the event. Colours are also pretty simple: putting emphasis on contrast of white paper and black ink with bright, red accents.

## Collaborators

Drawings are made by my friend, Wiktoria - you can go check out her profile on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/micekiewicz/)
